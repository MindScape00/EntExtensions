ReportMe | An Addon to disclaim that any issues should not be taken in "!ann" and should be handeled via a report.


Add "/reportme" & "/rm" as a command. Will post in !ANN a message and link. 

By Default, this message is "If you have a problem, report me: http://bit.ly/reportme1"

You can also change this message by using "/reportmeset" or "/rms" followed by the message you want.

Leaving "/rms" blank will set it back to default.


Current Version: 1.1 - Fixed bugs and better message setting / checking.
