v6.0.0 (Legion Release) (Aug. 16 2017) 
	- Redesigned / remade the Entry into the UnitPopupMenu frame with 2 main buttons under a general ConvenientCommands section
		- "Phase Mod" for the ModUI or quick buttons to Kick, List, or Unlist
		- "Phase Member" for quick buttons to add / remove / promote / demote a member.
		- (Note: Clicking "Phase Mod" will bring up the UI, but an entry is also available for "ModUI" - they are the same, just both options incase people miss that you can just click on "Phase Mod" for it)
